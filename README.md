### Lvls a lightweight reputational framework for contributor growth and retention

#### What is Lvls?

Lvls is a rewards framework for web3 contributor growth, retention, and progression. Current web3 ecosystems lack incentives for self-directed contributions and pathways for growth, with most rewards for positive contributions being pre-approved by DAO leaders. Lvls changes this by using a bonding curve to periodically reward contributions with soulbound tokens that measure the impact contributors have on the ecosystem.

These tokens, known as XP and LXP, provide a reputation budget that allows people or sub-daos to signal their impact in the community. Contributors can hold XP until it decays or exchange it for rewards tokens, allowing community members to assess their current active stake. Lvls enables DAOs to incentivize self-directed contribution, build community reputation, and transform communities of holders into active participants, creating more intrinsic and extrinsic value for web3 ecosystems.

#### Lukso

Our first round will be applying this xp scheme to Lukso's Universal Profile

#### Where do we go from here?

We'll work on defining the specifications for how bonding curves function, the shape of the allocation curve, and the burning curve that works for most projects. We'll also develop a user experience that either uses Discord for marking contributions or a simple frontend UX that allows people to propose contributions for an experience period.

Finally, we'll create an open-source server to manage the process.
